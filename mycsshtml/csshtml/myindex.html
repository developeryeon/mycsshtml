One attractive feature of structured documents is that the content can be reused in many contexts and presented in various ways. Different style sheets can be attached to the logical structure to produce different presentations.</span> used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1]

        <br>
        <span class="size">CSS</span> is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.
        This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant <span class="size">CSS</span> in a separate .<span class="size">CSS</span> file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .<span class="size">CSS</span> file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
